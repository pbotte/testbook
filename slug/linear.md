# Linear Regression with scikit-learn

This chapter teaches linear regression using `scikit-learn` with a dataset from 
[Deep Learning from HEP](https://hsf-training.github.io/deep-learning-intro-for-hep/).

Download the dataset from [here](https://github.com/hsf-training/deep-learning-intro-for-hep/blob/main/deep-learning-intro-for-hep/data/penguins.csv) 
and place it in a `data/` folder.

The dataset contains the basic measurements on 3 species of penguins!
